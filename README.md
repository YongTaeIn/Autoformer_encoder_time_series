# Autoformer encoder time series

### I implemented time series prediction using Autoformer's encoder.
Autoformer encoder code for predict time series data.
Note that series decomp is not used here,
It was implemented with a focus on applying attention using **autocorrelation**.

Framwork : Pytorch
